Most of my travels were\n          stressful as I was always afraid of missing my stop. Also, since I\n          could actually use my phone in the train thanks to the omnipresent\n          cellular connection — magic of the Japanese engineering, I was all the\n          more inclined to miss my stops since my attention was on the phone\n          rather than the route.\n        </p>\n        <BlockQuote\n          darkMode={darkMode}\n          quote={\n            \"What if my phone understood the line I used, and proposed an interface that would allow me to do something else on my phone rather than constantly having to check the route in the Maps app?\"\n          }\n          shadow={\"Relax\"}\n        />\n        <p className=\"article-paragraph\">\n          Imagine you’re eager to read Steve Jobs’ biography while riding Keio\n          Line towards Takaosan. Well now you can with a simple swipe.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"article-paragraph\">\n          This bubble that looks like a notification is what I call a « Live\n          Notification ». It doesn’t go away after a few seconds like a regular\n          one. Instead, it stays in reach all the time so you can access it very\n          quickly without interrupting your current workflow. To open\n          Notification Center, swipe further, in old iOS 10 Spotlight fashion.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"article-paragraph\">\n          Another area of iOS which would greatly benefit from this new paradigm\n          is Siri. Siri becoming a Live Notification paves the way for great new\n          possibilities, like this one, which I call « Siri Actions ». (After\n          Japan, I came back to France and studied for a year at a business\n          school which gave me the tendency to give names to everything. Pretty\n          useful.)\n        </p>\n        <BlockQuote\n          darkMode={darkMode}\n          quote={\"In iOS Mogi, Siri becomes a Live Notification.\"}\n          shadow={\"Assistant\"}\n        />\n        <p className=\"article-paragraph\">\n          You can ask Siri to find pictures for you and it will do so in the\n          background while you are typing to your friend! (A small side note on\n          the position of Siri. After iOS Mogi, I started seeing on the web a\n          lot of concepts which minified Siri and put it in a card at the\n          bottom: I think this is a mistake as it wouldn’t be possible to use\n          Siri at the same time as using the keyboard.)\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"article-paragraph\">\n          Siri also makes styling your email to Craig a lot easier!\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"article-paragraph\">\n          And that’s a wrap for iOS Mogi! I believe this new paradigm paves the\n          way for a wide array of actions and is another step towards an\n          AI-driven ecosystem that helps making its users’ life a bit easier.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"article-paragraph\">\n          Looking back on this concept I made about two years ago and published\n          last year, I do realize it has a few flaws here and there… but this is\n          the subject of another case study that I may publish in the coming\n          months and includes a full redesign of how notifications behave on iOS\n          (Spoiler: it’s called iOS Action Center).\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst selector = createSelector(\n  state => state[\"selected_concept\"],\n  state => state[\"concepts\"],\n  (selected_concept, concepts) => {\n    return {\n      selected_concept,\n      concepts\n    };\n  }\n);\n\nexport default connect(selector)(Mogi);\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
