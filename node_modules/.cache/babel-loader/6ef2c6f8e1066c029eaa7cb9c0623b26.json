I had to find my way through a huge\n          crowd of hungry salarymen and women (it was noon and I hadn’t slept\n          for a 24 hours) and the labyrinth-like organization of Shinjuku only\n          accentuated the feeling. I had a meeting two hours later in Shinjuku\n          with the person in charge of my guest house; yet, I barely made it on\n          time though the meeting spot was just less than a mile away from my\n          bus stop.\n        </p>\n        <ArticleImage\n          index={1}\n          currentMediaIndex={currentMediaIndex}\n          imgSrc={crowd}\n          mediaDescription={\n            \"Crowded (yet beautiful) Shinjuku.
